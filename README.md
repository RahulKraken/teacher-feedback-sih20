To make learning a serious goal classroom transaction needs to be improved. To bring in paradigm shift, the teacher needs feedback, review and support. In the existing system, there is no check for visit compliance. Visit reports are done on paper and half chance subjectivity. No data is available pertaining to visits for supporting the teacher to make data driven decisions, for example training diagoning the pedagogical issues, curriculum revision etc. In this context, we have tried to build a platform for automating the monitoring process. the teachers can access feedback reports on their teaching which is submitted by visiting officers.
